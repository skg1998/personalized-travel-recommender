Certainly! Here's a high-level system design for the Personalized Travel Recommender project:

1. Frontend (Angular):
   - User interface for user registration, login, profile management, and preferences.
   - Displays recommended destinations, itineraries, and search results.
   - Allows users to create, update, and delete their itineraries.
   - Provides a user-friendly interface for browsing destinations, reading reviews, and making bookings.
   - Integrates with backend APIs to fetch data and send user actions.

2. Backend (Spring Boot):
   - RESTful API endpoints for user management, destination data, recommendations, itineraries, reviews, and bookings.
   - Handles user authentication and authorization.
   - Manages user preferences and generates personalized recommendations.
   - Connects to external services (e.g., weather, mapping, booking) for data retrieval and integration.
   - Implements business logic for itinerary creation, modification, and deletion.
   - Validates user inputs, handles errors, and ensures data consistency.

3. Database (PostgreSQL):
   - Stores user information, preferences, and authentication data.
   - Contains destination details, reviews, and itinerary information.
   - Provides efficient querying and indexing for data retrieval.
   - Ensures data integrity and security.

4. External APIs:
   - Weather API: Retrieves weather information for destination and travel dates.
   - Mapping API: Displays interactive maps and provides routing functionality.
   - Booking API: Integrates with external booking services for accommodations and attractions.

5. Infrastructure:
   - Deploy the frontend application to a web server or a cloud-based hosting platform.
   - Deploy the backend application to a cloud-based platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud) or a dedicated server.
   - Use load balancers and auto-scaling mechanisms to handle increased traffic.
   - Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
   - Set up monitoring, logging, and error tracking systems for performance and troubleshooting.

This high-level system design provides an overview of the components and their interactions in the Personalized Travel Recommender project. It can serve as a starting point for further detailed design and implementation.
